Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? 

The client driver pass wanted an online system for helping people who are having a hard time passing their driver tests. A website where students can practice their driving tests and have access to study materials as well as get behind the wheel training 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?  

 Definitely if i had the chance to revise one document it would be my uml class diagram, i would add more details and make it neater and easier to read and follow. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 

I read the driver pass interview template thoroughly to be sure i included all of the client's needs. It's important to address all the client's needs so you don't need to go back in after the delivery to the client an change anything. Also, a happy client is a return client  

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? 

First i would get a clear understanding of what the client needs, what the requirements would be and designing a system to the customers satisfaction by paying close attention to the needs of the client.
